  text: 'They called it just a book. It came At Christmas with the other things. They called it just a book . . . To me, An eager child, it seemed to be A great white ship that sailed the sea— A ship with silver wings! They called it just a book, and said Twas mine to keep. They never knew How far from home I fared that year— To palm-fringed beaches, white and queer, Where swaggered many a  buccaneer, And opal dreams came true! A book . . . They never knew.',
